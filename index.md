# Running Virtual Reality Experiments Online: A Brief Introduction and Tutorial


How to use this resource: 
- It is designed to replicate a minimal pipline that sends (encrypted) data from a unity task to a web server where we can download it and decrypt it. 



Using the Notebooks and tools provided in onineVR-toolbox this leads you through all the steps. 

Notebooks available: 
1. Server
2. Encryption
3. Unity

# Requirements


Quickstart: 

This does not require uploading on steam. ALso does not require packaging task as a build. 

If you want to follow along, you will need Unity installed. We also assume a basic understanding of Unity and C# and python programming. However, none of the steps requrire you to do any coding. 
ALl code is pre-implemented and we go through the steps of how to configure this.

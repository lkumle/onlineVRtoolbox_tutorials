# Running Virtual Reality Experiments Online: A Brief Introduction and Tutorial

**Authors:** Levi Kumle, Alfie Brazier, Joel Kovoor, Johannes Keil, Anna C. Nobre & Dejan Draschkow

## Overview
This website hosts step-by-step practical Notebooks accompanying the tutorial "Running Virtual Reality Experiments Online: A Brief Introduction and Tutorial" and the [onlineVR-toolbox](https://github.com/lkumle/onlineVR-toolbox). 

The aim of these Notebooks and the onlineVR-toolbox is to provide a preimplemented solution for a core challenge of online data collection with VR: Implementing data transfer functionalities. Here, we present a minimal pipeline that implements communication between a Unity task and a web application, enabling the VR task to send and retrieve data through the internet. 

We recommend starting with reading the main tutorial paper for a high-level overview of the challenges of collecting data online for VR experiments. 

Here, we present three Notebooks, each tackling a discrete part of the pipline: 
1. Notebook 1: Implementing data transfer functionalities within Unity
2. Notebook 2: Setting up a web application that the Unity task can access
3. Notebook 3: Using decryption to ensure data security

These Noteboks go hand-in-hand with the resources provided within the onlineVR-toolbox. That is, together, they are designed to replicate a minimal pipline that sends (encrypted) data from a unity task to a web server where we can download it and decrypt it. 

## Requirements

F
Following the Notebooks does not require you to have your own Unity task ready
This does not require uploading on steam. ALso does not require packaging task as a build. 

If you want to follow along, you will need Unity installed. We also assume a basic understanding of Unity and C# and python programming. However, none of the steps requrire you to do any coding. 
ALl code is pre-implemented and we go through the steps of how to configure this.

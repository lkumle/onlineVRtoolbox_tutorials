## Step 2: Add basic web application

Next, we need to add a basic web application to our account on PythonAnywhere. Fortunately, PythonAnywhere provides a straightforward way to deploy and manage web apps with minimal effort.

---

**1. Add a new web application**
1. Navigate to the "Web" tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard.
2. Click *"+ Add a new web app"* to start the setup process.

**2. Configure the web application**

If you are using the provided bottle app script, select the following to configure the web application: 
> **python framework:** Bottle

> **python version:** 3.7

In "Quickstart new Bottle project", do not modify the default path. The path should look like the example below. 
   

{: .highlight-title}
> Note
>
> “TutorialTemplate” is the PythonAnywhere account name used for this tutorial. In your case, it will display your own account name.

**3. Finalizing the Setup**

Once the setup is complete, you will be redirected to a web app configuration page similar to the one below.

At the top, you will see your web address. You will need to use this exact URL in your experiment code later (see [Step 5](https://lkumle.github.io/onlineVRtoolbox_tutorials/docs/webApplication/Step5_testSetup.html) within this Notebook)

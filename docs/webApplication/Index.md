# Notebook 2: Set up web application
{: .no_toc }


## Overview
{: .no_toc }

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up a **web application** using **Bottle** on a remote **server** with **PythonAnywhere**. This will allow us to send and receive data between a Unity experiment and a server.

A web application is a program that runs on a server (e.g., PythonAnywhere) and can be accessed through a web browser or another client, such as Unity. Bottle is a lightweight Python web framework that simplifies the creation of web applications with minimal code.

While we could run our Bottle web application on any server, using platforms such as PythonAnywhere streamlines the process by providing:

- A hosted server that runs our Bottle app without requiring a dedicated machine.
- Automatic HTTPS support for secure data transmission.
- A web-based interface for easy configuration and monitoring.
